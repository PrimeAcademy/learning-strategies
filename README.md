# How to learn to code
advice on how to learn and practice code.

## read, write, speak, teach

__read:__ watching videos, listening to lectures, looking at other's code, reading books, reading documentation

__write:__ The process of breaking down a problem and solving it with code, including all the debugging that goes into that.

__speak:__ Describe what code is doing and how it works.

__teach:__ finding alternative ways of communicating to others in order to lead them to understanding. Being able to adjust how to explain code based on the audience.

These are all different skills,they can help eachother out, but it is totally normal to be at a stage where you feel like you can 'read' a piece of code, but have a really hard time 'writing' it.


WHen learning it can be very tempting to keep reading"


- Ways of googling
- ways of reading documentation
you don't have to read documentation like an article, you can skim it for the parts that may be helpful.
But watch out! But sometimes, reading something more thrououghly may be helpful.


- how to use examples you find
- asking questions:


- making hypotheses. Make a practice of making a hypothesis, or educated guess, about what your code will do before running it. This is a great thing to do with console logs.  Console log a value and check to see if you are correct about what the value is at that point in your code. After running see if you were right or not. If your hypothesis wasn't correct, try to figure out why.




- ways of working with others

-rubber ducking.
